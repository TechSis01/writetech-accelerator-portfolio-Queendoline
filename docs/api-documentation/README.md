## What I Improved
- Made the **Getting Started guide beginner-friendly**, so anyone can quickly start using Chimoney without prior experience.  
- Created **clear and structured API reference documentation** using the OpenAPI specification.  
- Organized endpoints and examples to make it **easy for developers to understand request and response flows**.

## Challenges
- I Encountered issues with the **Docusaurus OpenAPI plugin**, where some requests required fields in my specification were required on the "Try it out" section of the reference document rendered on my docusaurus site. This made testing the API faulty and confusing.

## What I Learnt
- How to **write and structure OpenAPI specification documents** effectively, including schemas, request bodies, response examples and component schemas. 
- First hand experience with the **Docusaurus OpenAPI plugin**, its installation and accurate rendering of the openapi specs on my docusaurus website. 
- How to **set up Chimoney and integrate its APIs**, I gained a significant amount of knowledge in cross-border payment workflows and multi-currency wallet management.
