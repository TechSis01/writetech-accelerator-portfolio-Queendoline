## 🌱 What I Learned
- I gained hands-on experience using Vercel, especially through the CLI. Before writing this article, I didn’t realize apps could be deployed directly via the CLI.
- I learned to approach the article from different reader perspectives, anticipating their possible scenarios and ensuring no important details were left out.
- I experimented with incorporating AI-generated images to add visual context. This also gave me the chance to practice prompt engineering—a crucial skill today for making AI tools more effective and improving overall efficiency.
