# GPT-4 AI Summary

GPT-4 is an advanced artificial intelligence system developed by OpenAI, a research organization focused on creating safe and beneficial AI. It represents the latest step in their ongoing work to build increasingly powerful language models, following earlier versions like GPT-3.5. Released in March 2023, GPT-4 was created after rebuilding OpenAI's entire technology infrastructure and collaborating with Microsoft Azure to design a specialized supercomputer. The development process included a test run with GPT-3.5 a year earlier, allowing the team to fix issues and make the training more stable and predictable.

The developers at OpenAI aimed to push the boundaries of AI by making it more capable, reliable, and safe. They focused on improving how the model handles complex tasks, aligns with human values, and refuses harmful requests. This involved months of testing and adjustments based on lessons from real-world use of previous models like ChatGPT, with a strong emphasis on safety to prepare for even more advanced AI in the future.

At its core, GPT-4's purpose is to process inputs like text and images and generate helpful text outputs. It can handle a wide range of activities, from casual conversations and creative writing to solving problems in fields like math, science, law, and coding. Unlike simpler AI, it's designed to be more nuanced, creative, and steerable—meaning users can guide its style and behavior through instructions—making it useful for applications in education, business, programming, and more.

The model was trained on a massive collection of data from the internet and licensed sources, teaching it to predict what comes next in text sequences. This pre-training used publicly available information up to September 2021. Afterward, it was refined using human feedback to better match user intentions while staying within safety boundaries, without learning from new experiences after deployment.

GPT-4's success is measured through various tests where it often matches or exceeds human performance. For instance, it scores in the top 10% on a simulated bar exam (compared to GPT-3.5's bottom 10%), excels in academic subjects like biology and history (top percentiles on AP exams), and outperforms other AI models on benchmarks for commonsense reasoning, coding, and reading comprehension. It also works well in 26 languages, beating predecessors even in less common ones like Welsh or Swahili. With image inputs, it can describe visuals, answer questions about them, and perform tasks like explaining humor in pictures. Internally, OpenAI uses it for tasks like customer support and content moderation, showing real-world effectiveness. Safety improvements reduced harmful responses by 82% compared to earlier models.

However, GPT-4 has limitations and risks. It can invent facts (known as "hallucinations"), make reasoning mistakes, or show biases from its training data. It doesn't know events after 2021, can't learn from interactions, and might accept false information too easily. While safer than before—it refuses dangerous requests more often—users can sometimes "jailbreak" it to bypass rules. High-stakes uses require extra checks, like human review, to avoid issues. OpenAI worked with experts to identify and mitigate risks, such as preventing advice on illegal activities, but ongoing monitoring is needed as AI grows more powerful.
