# Module Reflection 

For this module, I chose to work on OpenAI’s GPT-4 because it’s the model I’m most familiar with, and I was curious to learn more abou its inner workings.

I generated a prompt and queried the AI model Grok to produce a summary of GPT-4—covering its origins, training data, evaluation, risks, and mitigations.

After reviewing Grok’s output, I found it to be a a well written summary, but I made a few adjustments:

- I opened with a more engaging hook to capture the interest of readers across varying levels of technical knowledge.
- I trimmed down excess wording and simplified some of the jargon to make it more approachable.
- I reformatted the content into bullet points highlighting where GPT-4 stood out compared to its predecessors, making it easier to skim.
- I added a clear call to action at the end, along with direct links to the relevant pages for readers who wanted to explore further.

Overall, I believe I was able to analyze the original summary through the lens of multiple audiences and refine it into something more user-friendly, concise, and accessible.
