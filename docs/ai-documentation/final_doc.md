# Refined summary of GPT-4 by OpenAI
GPT-4, released by OpenAI in March 2023, is a significant advancement over earlier models like GPT-3 and GPT-3.5. OpenAI, an organization dedicated to developing safe and effective AI, collaborated with Microsoft Azure to build a specialized supercomputer for GPT-4’s training. A test run with GPT-3.5 in 2022 helped improve the process, focusing on capability and safety.

The model was trained on a large dataset from the internet up to September 2021 and licensed sources, enabling it to predict text sequences. Human feedback further refined it to align with user needs while prioritizing safety. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 processes both text and images, allowing it to describe visuals, answer questions about images, or explain visual content like humor. It excels in tasks such as conversations, creative writing, and problem-solving in fields like math, science, law, and coding. Users can guide its responses with specific instructions, making it valuable for education, business, and development.

GPT-4’s performance stands out in several areas:

- Scores in the top 10% on a simulated bar exam, compared to GPT-3.5’s bottom 10%.
- Achieves high marks in academic subjects like biology and history (top percentiles on AP exams).
- Outperforms other AI models in commonsense reasoning, coding, and reading comprehension.
- Supports 26 languages, including less common ones like Welsh and Swahili.
- Reduces harmful responses by 82% compared to earlier models.
- Used internally by OpenAI for tasks like customer support and content moderation.

Despite its strengths, GPT-4 has limitations. It may produce incorrect facts (known as “hallucinations”), make reasoning errors, or reflect biases from its training data. It lacks knowledge of events after September 2021, cannot learn from interactions, and may accept inaccurate information too readily. While safer, with improved handling of risky requests, it can sometimes be bypassed. OpenAI worked with experts to address risks, such as preventing advice on illegal activities, but ongoing oversight is necessary as AI evolves.

To get started, GPT-4o is available for free with an OpenAI (ChatGPT) account, though with limited usage. ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) gives you higher limits and priority access. Developers can use GPT-4o via the OpenAI API, and GPT-4 Turbo is also accessible through Microsoft Copilot at [copilot.microsoft.com](copilot.microsoft.com), with basic free access and more features in Copilot Pro.
