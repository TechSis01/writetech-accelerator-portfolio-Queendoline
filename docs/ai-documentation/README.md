| prompt_used.txt | Prompt(s) submitted to the AI tool |
| reflection.txt  | Personal reflections on improving the AI-generated content |

## 🔧 What I Did
- Researched GPT-4 in depth through articles, official documentation, and videos.
- Generated a summary on GPT-4 using AI  and critically refined it using technical writing best practices.
- Manually created a model card for GPT-4, then enhanced it with AI assistance while ensuring originality.


## 🌱 What I Learned
- Gained a deeper understanding of AI models, particularly transformers and neural networks, which form the foundation of GPT models.
- Learned the essential components of a model card and how to document one effectively after research.
- Improved skills in prompt engineering—designing inputs.
- Practiced refining raw AI output to align with technical writing standards, audience needs, and intended style.
