Supabase is an open-source, full-stack backend solution that provides developers with a robust set of tools and services to build applications quickly and efficiently. It's often described as a Firebase alternative, but it is built on a foundation of open-source tools, with its core being a powerful Postgres database.

Think of the traditional development process: you design your application's front end, but then you have to spend a significant amount of time building the backend from scratchâ€”setting up a database, configuring user authentication, and creating APIs. This can be a time-consuming and repetitive process.

Supabase simplifies this by offering all these foundational services for you, so you can focus on building the core features of your application. It provides:

- **Database**: A scalable Postgres database with a real-time API.

- **Authentication**: User management and authentication flows.

- **Storage**: File storage for things like images and videos.

- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for custom logic.


In the following sections, we will take a practical, hands-on approach to getting started with Supabase by learning how to set up a React project and connect it to your new Supabase backend.
