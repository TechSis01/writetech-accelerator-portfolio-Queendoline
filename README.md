# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I completed technical writing projects across various domains ‚Äî including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3 ‚Äî using modern documentation workflows and tools.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm a technical writer with a background in web development, passionate about turning complex technical concepts into clear, accessible content for users and developers. I create well-structured documentation, user guides, installation manuals, SDK and API references, and release notes that empower my audience to understand and use products with confidence.  This portfolio highlights the practical skills I‚Äôve built during the WriteTech Accelerator.
