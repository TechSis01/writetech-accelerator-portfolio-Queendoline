Drafting and storing documents in physical folders and placing them on their designated shelves at company offices was the only way to keep them safe for future reference back in the 70’s. Although this practice has not gone completely extinct, the use of digital repositories in the 21st century have completely redefined how companies store and access their documents.  

Let’s imagine this, you work at the office as a secretary and a fateful friday afternoon during the holidays, you receive a distressing phone call about a faulty wiring at the office basement that led to a sudden explosion, setting the whole office ablaze and  turning all office appliances including important documents stored in the office into ashes.  

The situation is not just unfortunate because the company will have to shoulder unplanned costs to rebuild the office,but also because of the irreplaceable loss of  important documents that were stored in print form that could derail the company’s operations. 

To avoid situations like these, businesses should adopt the use of digital storage spaces commonly known as online repositories to store their documents as soon as they’re created.

### Three reasons your why company needs a digital repository

Merriem webster’s dictionary defines a repository as a place, room, or container where something is depositored or storied. Repositories could be physical or digital. and today we are going to highlight a few reasons why a digital repository is important and why your business should invest in one. 


**Fast Document Retrieval**

You’re a part of an important stakeholder meeting, suddenly your boss askes you to present a stakeholder contract document, you check your folder of documents and soon realise you accidently left it in your office drawer.  There is an awkward deafening silence, everyone is watching you trying to scurry over a pile of papers from the folder, and then you’re up on your feet dashing out of the conference room to your office to grab the document from your drawer. Not only is this a little embarrassing, you have lost so much valuable time at the meeting, ultimately showing some level of incompetence from you and this ultimately reflects badly on your company. A digital repository could have made the  experience above smoother, all you would have had to do when your boss voiced out the instruction would be to type the said document in the search bar to make a query to the database where all the documents are being stored and  this would have saved you more time and frustration.

**Collaboration made Easy**

Great collaboration is the core of an effective team, a scenario where teammates can easily create, store documents and give access to  other team mates eligible to view these documents with just a few clicks and tabs on their computers, increases the efficiency and workrate of the team. A digital repository allows everyone to have a sense of inclusivity and togetherness when working on projects together. For instance, when a member from the development team needs to read through the Product requirement document of the project, there would be little to no need of contacting the project manager because documents like these would be readily available to members of the team. This fosters inclusivity, improves efficiency, and ensures everyone stays on the same page.

**Cost Reduction**
A digital repository is like purchasing virtual book shelves and multiple physical folders. But the interesting part about a digital repostiory is that, you do not have to worry about furniture maintenance,  or purchasing new folders and papers periodically which would take up space and cause a clutter if not properly maintained and organized.With a digital repository there’s no need  worry about constantly adding paper and folder cost to your company’s monthly budget, since 80% of document management is done virtually. This allows your company to allocate funds to other ventures that would drive a positive and exponential growth.
