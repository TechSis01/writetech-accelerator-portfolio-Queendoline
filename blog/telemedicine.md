The pandemic brought about a revolution in the healthcare system, and five years later, telemedicine has been adopted worldwide.

The middle-aged lady who works at a coffee shop admits to the convenience of scheduling weekly check-ins with her doctor to monitor her ever-spiking blood pressure. The janitor who works at the adult learning school testifies that he narrowly escaped a heart attack in the middle of the night after he reached out to the first available doctor, who guided him with a quick remedy at home before he was able to visit the clinic at daybreak.

But Ms. Claire, who just turned 75 and works as a nanny at the local daycare center, says that, on occasions when she has tried to use a telemedicine application, it usually ended in frustration and chaos. She would prefer to visit the hospital physically. 

Ms. Claire had had it with telemedicine when her doctor recommended she take daily walks over a video call, and she misheard that for taking daily worms, which almost landed her in the ICU.

## Older Adults Want Telemedicine, But Technology Gets in the Way

 A 2022 study on the [barriers to telemedicine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9066341/) found that, although 70% of older adults have access to the internet and technology, 30% are unfamiliar with technology, 29.7% don't know how to use these applications, and only 11% feel comfortable using telemedicine apps. These findings confirmed that as people get older, technology becomes less comforting to them, but old age does not reduce interest in telemedicine. 

Not only do they struggle with telemedicine due to technological know-how barriers, but age-related health issues, such as vision difficulties, hearing loss, reduced motor skills, slower information processing, and multitasking challenges, create compounding obstacles that limit the use of telemedicine applications for older adults. 

Furthermore, the research shows that 54.6% of non-English speakers cite language as their top challenge when using these applications.

Of course, Ms. Claire doesn’t want to travel 10 miles every week just to get a doctor’s checkup; she is just wary of spending hours trying to connect to the internet, figuring out how to log in to the application, how to get connected to her doctor, and the host of other functions embedded in these applications.

But the truth is, Older people want to use telemedicine, but the technology feels too hard for them. So the top barrier for them is confidence in using these applications, and not overall interest.

## Four Essential Strategies for Product Teams

Many telemedicine companies have sought to address these issues for older adults, recognizing that creating applications that are accessible to them would ultimately improve their quality of life and maintain the continuity of their care. 

A simple scenario, such as a delay in a virtual consultation, could worsen their condition, thereby increasing treatment costs. Along with that, the frustration of using these technologies could increase their stress, leading to higher cortisol levels and accelerating a decline in their health, mainly affecting cognition, bones, muscles, immunity, and cardiovascular health.

How can telemedicine companies ensure that their products are inclusive and that older adult citizens can still enjoy the benefits of virtual care despite these crippling limitations?

* **Simplify user experience**: Telemedicine apps should have a fast learning curve and avoid many protocols when users try to perform core functions. An example is ensuring that booking a consultation with a doctor follows a simple, logical sequence, without requiring the user to make too many complex decisions in between. Most older adults have short attention spans, so product owners want to ensure that tasks can be completed as quickly as possible.  
    
* **Enable shared access to caregivers**: Products should be designed so that a caregiver or family member can access the accounts as well, including receiving notifications and updates, and providing real-time assistance from another location to the older adult.   
    
* **Optimize for low-bandwidth environments:** Many older adults prefer to stay in remote rural areas, which are often characterized by lower noise levels**,** tranquility, and limited or no network connectivity. Telemedicine apps must be optimized for low-connectivity settings by enabling offline access to key features, adapting video quality to network conditions, and supporting low-bandwidth technologies that ensure essential services function reliably.  
    
* **Provide comprehensive audio, visual, and language support**: Telemedicine apps should be screen reader-friendly to support older adults with vision impairments. Apps should include text-to-speech, voice search, and even voice-guidance features, especially for presenting onboarding tips to users. To help users with hearing impairments, auto-generated captions should be available, especially for voice and audio communications on the app. Apps should also offer multilingual support, allowing users to select their preferred language and providing precise, simple translations to ensure information is easily understood across different linguistic backgrounds.

## Policy & Organizational Support

While product teams bear primary responsibility for accessible designs, state policymakers, private health organizations, and community leaders are not exempt from efforts to make telemedicine platforms more accessible to older adults. Let’s explore a few ways they can contribute to support this movement.

* **Improve Internet accessibility**: Steps should be taken to ensure internet access is available everywhere, especially in remote regions. This will make it easier for older adults in this region to access telemedicine benefits and reduce the frustration they would typically face with a poor internet connection.   
    
* **Invest in Digital Literacy Programs:** Organizations should develop and fund training programs for older adults to improve their basic digital skills, ensuring hands-on, practical education on these telehealth technologies. This also includes teaching them to understand that telemedicine is designed to augment physical hospital visits and not to replace them.   
    
* **Provide Financial Aid and Subsidization:** Access to telehealth services is sometimes limited due to older adults' financial constraints. Financial support and subsidization of tools and services, such as internet access, device costs, or insurance payments, are needed to make telehealth more affordable and prevent older adults from being prevented from using digital healthcare due to cost.

Telemedicine is for everyone, regardless of age. As this technology continues to grow, founders must design inclusively from day zero to ensure their products serve not just a fraction of users, but the vast majority, including older adults aged 70 and above.
